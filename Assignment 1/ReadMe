This project is a Flask-based web application that implements the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method for multi-criteria decision making.

Users can upload a CSV file containing alternatives and criteria values, provide corresponding weights and impacts, and submit their email ID. The application processes the data using the TOPSIS algorithm, generates a ranked result file, and sends the output CSV to the user via email.

The project demonstrates the integration of backend logic, web interface, and email communication, and also reuses the previously developed TOPSIS Python package for modularity and code reusability.
