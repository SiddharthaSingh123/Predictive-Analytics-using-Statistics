Methodology, Results, and Analysis
1. Methodology

This project uses the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method, which is a widely used Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) technique.
The objective of TOPSIS is to rank a set of alternatives by comparing their closeness to an ideal best solution and their distance from an ideal worst solution.

The overall methodology followed in this project is explained below.

Step 1: Input Data Collection

The input is provided in the form of a CSV file.

The first column of the file represents the alternatives (such as products, projects, or options).

The remaining columns represent the decision criteria.

In addition, the user provides:

Weights, which indicate the importance of each criterion.

Impacts, where:

+ denotes a benefit criterion (higher value is preferred),

- denotes a cost criterion (lower value is preferred).

Step 2: Normalization of the Decision Matrix

Since different criteria may be measured using different units and scales, normalization is performed.
Normalization converts all criterion values into dimensionless values, ensuring that they are comparable and no single criterion dominates the decision due to scale differences.

Step 3: Weighted Normalized Decision Matrix

After normalization, each criterion value is multiplied by its corresponding weight.
This step incorporates the relative importance of each criterion into the decision-making process and reflects the preferences of the decision-maker.

Step 4: Determination of Ideal Best and Ideal Worst Solutions

Based on the impacts provided by the user:

Ideal Best Solution represents the most desirable values for each criterion.

Ideal Worst Solution represents the least desirable values for each criterion.

For benefit criteria, higher values are considered better, while for cost criteria, lower values are preferred.

Step 5: Distance Calculation

For each alternative, the distance from both the ideal best solution and the ideal worst solution is calculated.
These distances indicate how close or far an alternative is from the most desirable and least desirable scenarios.

Step 6: TOPSIS Score Calculation

A TOPSIS score is computed for each alternative based on its relative closeness to the ideal best solution and distance from the ideal worst solution.

The score lies between 0 and 1.

A higher score indicates a better alternative.

Step 7: Ranking of Alternatives

Alternatives are ranked in descending order of their TOPSIS scores.
The alternative with the highest score is assigned Rank 1, indicating it as the most preferred option.

2. Result Table

After processing the input data, the output is generated in the form of a CSV file containing:

Column Name	Description
Alternative Name	Name or ID of the alternative
Criteria Columns	Original values of decision criteria
TOPSIS Score	Calculated performance score
Rank	Final rank of the alternative
Interpretation

Alternatives with higher TOPSIS scores are considered better.

The ranking helps decision-makers select the most suitable alternative based on multiple criteria.

3. Result Graph (Optional Visualization)

A graphical representation of the results can be created using a bar chart or line chart, where:

The X-axis represents alternatives.

The Y-axis represents TOPSIS scores.

Purpose of the Graph

Provides a clear visual comparison among alternatives.

Makes the decision-making process more intuitive.

Helps identify alternatives with similar performance.

4. Web Application Workflow

The user uploads the input CSV file.

The user enters weights, impacts, and an email ID.

The Flask backend validates all inputs.

The TOPSIS algorithm is applied to the data.

A result CSV file is generated.

The output file is sent to the user via email.

5. Advantages of the Approach

Effectively handles multiple conflicting criteria.

Computationally efficient and easy to implement.

Easy to understand and interpret.

Scalable for real-world decision-making problems.

Modular design combining algorithmic logic and web interface.

6. Applications of TOPSIS

Product selection

Supplier evaluation

College or course selection

Investment decision-making

Resource prioritization

7. Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of the TOPSIS method and its integration into a user-friendly web application.
By combining decision-making algorithms with Python programming and web development, the system provides a practical and scalable solution for solving real-world multi-criteria decision problems.
